Streamside Artifacts & Their SecretsThis document details the unique items found throughout the village, their connection to the inhabitants, and the dialogue and relationship changes that occur when the player presents them to the correct person.1. The Hand-Carved Wooden Fish LureLocation: Outdoor Area: West Bank (Tucked into a coil of rope on Kael's boat)Associated Character: Kael, the Old FishermanSignificance: This lure was a gift to Kael from his son, who was lost at sea years ago in a storm. It is carved from a wood foreign to Streamside because his son was a sailor on a merchant vessel that traveled to distant lands. Kael believes he lost it during the recent shipwreck storm and is heartbroken, seeing it as a final severing of his connection to his son.Presenting the Artifact:Reaction: Kael will stop his work, his stoic facade breaking for a moment. He will take the lure with a trembling hand, overcome with quiet emotion.Dialogue Unlocked: He will share the story of his son, revealing his deep-seated fear and hatred of the sea's cruelty. This provides context for his silence and unease. He will also mention that the recent storm felt different—more malicious—than the one that took his son.Relationship Change: Trust +30%. Kael will now see the player not as an outsider, but as a kindred spirit who has also suffered loss at the hands of the sea.2. The Silver LocketLocation: Lord Alistair's House (On the corner of the dresser)Associated Character: Maeve, the Villager GirlSignificance: The locket belonged to Maeve's grandmother and contains a portrait of her grandfather, who she never met. Lord Alistair took it as payment for her family's debts. Maeve believes it was sold and is gone forever; she misses it dearly as her only link to her family's past.Presenting the Artifact:Reaction: Maeve's eyes will fill with tears of joy. She will be stunned that the player found it and returned it to her.Dialogue Unlocked: Out of immense gratitude, Maeve will trust the player completely. She will start sharing gossip she overhears in the manor, eventually revealing a key detail: she saw Lord Alistair hide a "shiny gold ring with a bird on it" in his study after the storm.Relationship Change: Trust +40%. Maeve becomes a firm ally, willing to help the player in any small way she can.3. The Soggy, Salt-Stained PouchLocation: The Merchant's Shed (Half-hidden under a pile of ropes)Associated Character: Seraphina, the MerchantSignificance: This pouch contains coins from the player's kingdom, bearing the mark of a falcon—the royal crest. Seraphina missed it when sorting through the salvaged goods she bought from Alistair. For her, it's tangible proof that the player's shipwreck is tied to wealth and power.Presenting the Artifact:Reaction: Seraphina's cynical demeanor will be replaced by greedy curiosity. She will inspect the coins closely, her mind racing.Dialogue Unlocked: She will become much more willing to talk, seeing the player as a potential source of profit. She'll reveal that she bought a locked, waterlogged journal from Alistair that also came from the wreck, and will offer to sell it to the player, believing it contains valuable secrets.Relationship Change: Trust +20%. Her trust is purely transactional, but it's enough to make her a useful, if unreliable, source of information.4. The Glimmering Nightshade BlossomLocation: The Dilapidated House (Pressed inside a book on the central table)Associated Character: Brenna, the HerbalistSignificance: This is an extremely rare magical ingredient that only blooms during unnatural weather phenomena, like the magical storm. Brenna found it on the beach near where she discovered the player. By finding the blossom in her book, the player shows they are observant and not just another ignorant villager.Presenting the Artifact:Reaction: Brenna will give the player a rare, knowing smile. She will be impressed by their perception.Dialogue Unlocked: Seeing the player as someone who might understand, she will stop speaking in riddles. She will confide that she believes the storm was a magical attack and that the blossom is proof. She will warn the player that powerful forces may be at play.Relationship Change: Trust +25%. She will begin to treat the player less as a patient and more as a confidant.5. The Old Iron KeyLocation: Outdoor Area: East Bank (Embedded in the chopping block)Associated Character: Silas, the HunterSignificance: This key doesn't belong to anyone in the village. It is, in fact, the key to the waterlogged journal that Seraphina possesses. It likely fell from one of the assassins' pockets during the fight and washed ashore. The coiled serpent is the symbol of the assassin's guild.Presenting the Artifact:Reaction: Silas will be suspicious. He will recognize the serpent symbol from markings left by poachers and bandits he has driven from the woods. He will demand to know where the player found it.Dialogue Unlocked: If the player is honest, Silas's suspicion will shift from the player to the true source of the shipwreck. He will see the player not as a cause of the conflict, but as a target. He will share his full story of witnessing the naval battle from the cliffs.Relationship Change: Trust +30%. Gaining Silas's trust is difficult, but this proves the player is on the same side. He will see them as an ally against a common threat.6. The Feather-Shaped BookmarkLocation: The Old Windmill (Inside a book on a reading table)Associated Character: Brother Theron, the MonkSignificance: The bronze feather is a symbol of the scholarly monastic order from which Brother Theron was exiled. It was his only personal possession, a reminder of his old life. He thought he had lost it forever.Presenting the Artifact:Reaction: Brother Theron will be visibly moved, a deep sadness and gratitude in his eyes.Dialogue Unlocked: The return of this deeply personal item will convince him of the player's good character. He will confess his full story: he is a disgraced monk in hiding, and he recognized the magic used to summon the storm from forbidden texts he once studied. He can offer specific insight into the nature of the forces hunting the player.Relationship Change: Trust +35%. He becomes a dedicated mentor, actively helping the player decipher the clues they find.
