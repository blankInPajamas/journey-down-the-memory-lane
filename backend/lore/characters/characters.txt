Streamside Amnesia: Plot & Character Dossier
Main Plot

The player awakens on a simple cot inside a dusty, herb-scented, dilapidated house. They have no memory of who they are, where they came from, or how they arrived. The first person they see is Brenna, a mysterious old woman who found them unconscious on the shore.

The player's goal is to piece together their identity and the events that led to their memory loss. This can only be achieved by speaking to the inhabitants of Streamside village. Each villager holds a piece of the puzzle, but their willingness to share information will depend on the player's actions, conversation choices, and their ability to build trust. The game revolves around navigating complex relationships, uncovering secrets, and ultimately confronting the truth of the player's past.
The Central Mystery: What Happened to the Player?

The player, whose real name is Caspian, was a royal courier. They were shipwrecked during a violent, unnatural storm while carrying a sealed letter of great political importance from a neighboring kingdom. The letter contained a peace treaty proposal, but a faction within Caspian's own kingdom wanted a war to break out. This faction hired assassins to intercept the message.

The assassins' ship attacked Caspian's vessel near Streamside. In the ensuing chaos, Caspian fought bravely but was wounded and knocked overboard. The assassins, believing Caspian drowned and the letter was lost to the sea, retreated. Caspian washed ashore, battered and without memories, where Brenna discovered them. The sealed letter, protected by a waterproof oilskin pouch, is still with them, though they don't know its significance. The villagers witnessed the storm and the wreckage, but each saw or heard something different, and their interpretations are colored by their own biases and secrets.
