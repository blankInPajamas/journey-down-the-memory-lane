The Shipwreck: A Detailed AccountThis document details the sequence of events that led to the player's (Caspian's) amnesia and outlines each villager's specific connection to the incident.A Moment-by-Moment AccountLate Afternoon: Caspian's ship, the Sea Serpent, sails towards the coast near Streamside. The weather is clear. A larger, faster ship, the Shadowfin, bearing no flags, appears and gives chase.The Attack: The Shadowfin closes the distance. Its crew, hired assassins, launch grappling hooks and board the Sea Serpent. Caspian, a trained courier, draws their sword and defends the sealed letter they carry. The sounds of a fierce battle—shouting and the clash of steel—begin to carry on the wind toward the village.The Unnatural Storm: As the fight rages, the sky darkens with impossible speed. A storm with a strange, violet-hued core descends directly upon the two ships, moving against the natural wind patterns. The sea churns violently.The Climax: During the chaotic fight on the rain-slicked deck, Caspian is engaged in a duel with the assassin leader. A rogue wave crashes over the side, causing Caspian to lose their footing. The assassin leader seizes the opportunity and strikes Caspian on the head with the pommel of his sword.Memory Loss and the Sea: The blow is powerful and disorienting. Stunned and bleeding, Caspian stumbles backward, trips over a fallen mast, and is thrown overboard into the raging sea. The assassins, seeing Caspian disappear into the storm-tossed waves and their ship beginning to break apart, presume their target is dead and the letter is lost. They retreat on the damaged Shadowfin.Washing Ashore: Caspian, kept afloat by the oilskin pouch containing the letter, is carried by the current. They lose consciousness and eventually wash up on the beach near Streamside, where they are found as the storm subsides. The physical trauma of the head wound, combined with the shock of the event, results in total amnesia.The Villagers' Perspectives1. Brenna, the HerbalistAffiliation: The RescuerWhat she knows: Brenna was on the shoreline when the storm hit. She found Caspian's unconscious body tangled in seaweed. She noted the fine clothes, the deep cut on their head, and the oilskin pouch clutched in their hand. She administered immediate first aid and, with Finn's help, carried Caspian to her cottage.2. Lord Alistair, the LandlordAffiliation: The ProfiteerWhat he knows: From his manor, he saw the storm and the subsequent wreckage. The next morning, he found a locked chest from the Sea Serpent. He broke it open and discovered the royal signet ring. He is aware that the player is tied to nobility or a royal house and is plotting how to use this for personal gain.3. Silas, the HunterAffiliation: The Distant WitnessWhat he knows: He was tracking game on the high cliffs and had the clearest view of the initial attack. He saw the larger ship attack the smaller one and witnessed flashes of steel. The storm blocked his view before he could see the outcome. He is convinced the player is a warrior and brings conflict with them.4. Brother Theron, the MonkAffiliation: The Arcane ObserverWhat he knows: From the top of the windmill, he observed the storm's formation. He knows it was magically conjured due to its unnatural speed, color, and movement. He fears the player was the target of a magical assault and is deeply concerned about the forces at play.5. Seraphina, the MerchantAffiliation: The Recipient of GoodsWhat she knows: She purchased a crate of damaged goods from Alistair. Within it, she found a waterlogged journal she cannot open. She knows it came from the wreck and is suspicious of its contents, believing it might be valuable or dangerous.6. Kael, the Old FishermanAffiliation: The Auditory WitnessWhat he knows: Caught in the outer edges of the storm, his primary experience was auditory. Over the wind, he distinctly heard the sounds of a naval battle—shouts, orders, and the ringing of swords—which the storm's natural sounds could not explain.7. Maeve, the Villager GirlAffiliation: The Close ObserverWhat she knows: She saw Brenna and Finn carrying the player from the beach. From her vantage point, she got a clear look at the player's head wound before Brenna applied a bandage. She also noticed the hilt of the sword they carried, which looked far too elegant for a simple sailor.8. Finn, the Hardworking VillagerAffiliation: The First ResponderWhat he knows: Checking his crab pots after the storm, Finn was the first villager to find the player on the sand. He confirmed they were alive and called for Brenna's help. He clearly saw the silver-inlaid sword at the player's hip, a weapon of obvious quality and expense.9. Elara, the HousekeeperAffiliation: The EavesdropperWhat she knows: A few days after the incident, she overheard a tense conversation between Lord Alistair and a menacing visitor who was asking about a "royal courier" from a shipwreck. She heard Alistair lie and deny finding anyone. She now knows that dangerous people are actively searching for the player.
